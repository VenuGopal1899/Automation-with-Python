## You're working with an accountant named Arthur.

Arthur has a client, Matilda.  Matilda is 68 years old and sells cupcakes.  Matilda is not a big fan of spreadsheets, accounting software, or computers in general really.

Every so often Matilda sends Arthur three files:

###### Basic.txt, Delux.txt, and Total.txt

Naturally, as any savvy business owner, Matilda wants to understand her business.  So she sends Arthur those files and wants to know: "How much money did I make last year? How much money do I make in a typical month?  Can you help, please? I do need your help,  I'm very busy baking cupcakes, and my arthritis flares up when I spend a whole day on the calculator."

To be totally honest, Arthur is not Matilda's biggest fan right now.  Arthur is glad he finally got her to type up this info and email it instead of faxing it, but she flat out won't do anything more complicated than this.

It could be worse, Matilda is a woman of routine:

    These documents never have dates, each line was entered on a different day.  The bottom-most row is always 'Today', the row 
    above that is 'Yesterday', and so on. The files are always lined up perfectly, you never have to worry about them being 
    'out of sync' or anything like that.

    Basic.txt is the number of basic cupcakes she sold on that day, and they cost $5.
    Deluxe.txt is the number of Deluxe cupcakes (they have sprinkles!) sold on that day, and they cost $6.
    Total.txt is the total money she made (let's not even think about taxes yet, ugh).

## Matilda every so often wants to know:

    1) Yearly Revenue Totals
    2) Monthly Revenue Totals
    3) Weekly Revenue Totals

I'll bet that this week you can code something up that will take these text files in and spit those answers out, whenever she asks.

## If you want to get fancy, here's how you might take it even further:

    4) Break these stats down by item.
    5) Generate a graph of the data, Matilda loves charts
    6) Get creative with the input.  Maybe you can think of something she'll actually use.
    
## Command and Requirements:
    Note: CSV module comes by default with python, else just install with the command pip3 install python3-csv
    python3 program.py
